## Disclaimer...
These files were originally created to fit my own personal preference.

I'm not an artist nor am I "skilled" with Affinity Designer. I just have a particular preference for how my notes look in GoodNotes. If you spot any problems within these files you are free to make the correction and submit a pull-request or let me know what needs to be tweaked and I will attempt the fix as I have time.
